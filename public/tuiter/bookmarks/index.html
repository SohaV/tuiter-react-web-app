                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
                Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
                the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                    Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think,
                    feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy
                    choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through
                    adulthood. Although the terms are often used interchangeably, poor mental health and mental illness
                    are not the same. A person can experience poor mental health and not be diagnosed with a mental
                    illness. Likewise, a person diagnosed with a mental illness can experience periods of physical,
                    mental, and social well-being.

                        <p class="wd-para-2">Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall
                            health.  For example, depression increases the risk for many types of physical health
                            problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.
                            Similarly, the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness.<br>

                    The strongest storms over southeastern Massachusetts, including the Cape and Islands. Expecting
                    areas of heavy downpours, pockets of street flooding and some lightning. While the chances remain
                    low, we cannot completely rule out a quick spin-up tornado or water spout in that area.
                    Main timeframe for round 1 is between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m.
